## Description

OmniGrub is a web application that helps users find restaurants around their location and compare their reviews from Yelp, Google Places, and Foursquare. The application integrates with the Yelp Fusion, Google Places, and Foursquare Places APIs to retrieve restaurant data, including reviews, ratings, and locations. Users can also save their favorite restaurants and create custom lists to organize their dining preferences. User data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, and Google OAuth is used for user authentication.
